## Hi, I'm Charity Cheruto Chalangat!

I'm a computer science student at Mount Kenya University with a strong focus on web development. 
I love creating functional, dynamic websites, and I'm also deeply interested in the exciting fields of AI, ,ML, and Data science. 
I'm constantly exploring new ways to integrate these technologies to solve real-world problems and drive innovation.
